## About

Buildy is a website builder that has been built off of Node.js and Express, I aim to make Buildy as fast as possible - therefore, it uses EJS and JavaScript ES6, as (in my personal experience), EJS seems to load everything much faster. I have considered React, though I do not know much of it - so I will be playing it safe. As for ES6, I think that's pretty obvious why I'm using that instead of common JavaScript.

## Initialization

Due to my using of yarn, just [install yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) and run the command `yarn` to install all dependencies

## Dependencies

As mentioned in my `package.json`, the dependencies are:

`dotenv` Secret information :shushing_face:\
`ejs` Templating engine for the website's interface\
`ejs-lint` More descriptive EJS errors\
`express` Creating and handling the webserver
